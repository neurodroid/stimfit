This directory contains scripts which may be used to build __and install__ this
software on different platforms. Be careful, these were written for testing
the build system and often ran in isolated docker container. You can refer to
them for required softwares and steps.

For example, on a Ubuntu system, run the following command in a Ubuntu container.

`
$ ./build_stimfit_ubuntu.sh
`
