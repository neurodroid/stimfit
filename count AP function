""" I have been using the function count_events from stimfit
in order to count action potentials in several selected traces.
The function returns a table containing the number of AP/traces and use the regular 
count_events function of spells. The function created: counting allow to 
count the action potentials for several traces selected, and works well (line 10-20). However 
I would like this function to return in the table the time of the events. To do so 
I have modified the count_events function this way (line 22-92). However now 
only -1 one is returned from this section. I am not sure why?"""

    Counts the number of events (e.g action potentials (AP)) in the current trace.

    Arguments:

    start       -- starting time (in ms) to look for events.
    delta       -- time interval (in ms) to look for events.
    threshold   -- (optional) detection threshold (default = 0).
    up          -- (optional) True (default) will look for upward events,
                    False downwards.
    trace       -- (optional) zero-based index of the trace in the current 
                    channel, if None, the current trace is selected.
    mark        -- (optional) if True (default), set a mark at the point 
                    of threshold crossing
    Returns:
    An integer with the number of events.

    Examples:
    count_events(500,1000) returns the number of events found between t=500
         ms and t=1500 ms above 0 in the current trace and shows a stf 
         marker.
    count_events(500,1000,0,False,-10,i) returns the number of events found
         below -10 in the trace i and shows the corresponding stf markers.
